
== Submission Tutorial

If you're new to git and GitHub and just want to keep things as simple as possible, this tutorial will give you a quick and easy way to make your contribution.  Here are the steps you'll need to follow:

=== Create a GitHub account

To create and edit a page or to comment on an existing page, you will need to create an account on GitHub. If you don't have one already, then go to the https://github.com/signup/free[GitHub Signup page]. It's free.

GitHub has excellent tools for collaborating and workflow management, and will be the primary way we communicate with you over the course of the project.

=== Copy ("fork") the project repository to your account 

Once you've got an account, fork (GitHub lingo for copying) the main project to your account.  To do this, go to the  https://github.com/oreillymedia/etudes-for-erlang[Etudes for Erlang] repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button at the upper right hand side of the screen.

The following screen will appear while GitHub copies the repository to your account:

=== Click the "+" button next to the directory name to create a new file

Locate the small "\+" sign next to the repository name.  (A tooltip will appear that says "Create a new file here" when you hover your mouse above it.)  Click the "\+" button:

=== Name the file and enter your title

In the new screen: 

* Enter a name for the file.  You should name the file using the convention using your first and last name with an ".asciidoc" at the end.  For example, "andrew_odewahn.asciidoc".
* Enter the title in the editing box; it should be prefaced with two "==" signs.  For example, "== Always Foo the Bar"
* Once you've entered the filename and title, the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom of the screen will activate.  Click the button to save your file.

You will see something like this:

=== Edit your file using AsciiDoc

Once you've got the file created, you can start editing it at your leisure.  Remember to:

* Mark up your text using http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc], which is similar to Markdown and other basic wiki-like markup formats.
* Change the line wrapping from "No Wrap" to "Soft Wrap."  Otherwise, all your text will appear on a single line.

To edit the file, all you have to do is click its name in the directory listing in GitHub and then press the "Edit" button.

=== Double check your submission and add your biography

Before you submit your request, make sure that you have:

* Run a spell check
* Make sure it's 400-500 words in length
* Add your name, biography, and a link to an image you'd like us to use in the book.  (Please be sure to just send us a link -- don;t check your image into the repository, please.)
* Check the formatting to make sure it looks OK

Your biography should look like this:
